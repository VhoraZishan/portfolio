          SkillMatch is a web-based application designed to assist individuals in finding the most suitable jobs based on their skills. The system leverages machine learning algorithms—specifically Random Forest for classification and TF-IDF vectorization for text-based skill analysis—to predict and display relevant job roles dynamically. Built using Streamlit, the app offers a modern UI with an intuitive user experience.
