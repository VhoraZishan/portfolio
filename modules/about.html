   ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zishan â€” a third-year Computer Engineering student and fast learner, currently exploring various domains in tech. Iâ€™m especially drawn to DevOps, backend development, and solving problems that require structured thinking over visual design.
I love designing systems that work behind the scenes â€” automating tasks, managing infrastructure, and keeping things running smoothly.
Still trying to make peace with CSS, but hey â€” servers donâ€™t care about uncentered divs.
